# Semantic Square - Memory Enhancing Game

Semantic Square is a memory-enhancing game developed as a part of the Advanced Python course in Cognitive Science. The game is designed to help players improve their memory and cognitive skills by challenging them to recall the correct order of words in a given sentence. 

## How to Play

1. **Sentence Presentation**: At the start of each round, a sentence related to cognitive science is presented to the player.

2. **Word Shuffling**: Below the sentence, the words from that sentence are displayed on squares, but in a shuffled order.

3. **Memory Challenge**: After a brief period, the words on the squares disappear, and it's your turn to remember the correct order of the words from the sentence.

4. **Word Placement**: Click on the squares in the order that you believe is correct, placing the words in the right sequence.

5. **Scoring**: Your score is based on how accurately you recreate the original sentence. The game keeps track of your statistics and progress over time.

## Game Features

- **Cognitive Science Content**: Sentences used in the game are collected from Bermudez, 2014, with the intention of helping players learn material related to cognitive science.

- **Statistical Tracking**: Semantic Square collects player statistics, including scores, completion times, and accuracy. These statistics can be useful for various experimental designs and cognitive science research.
